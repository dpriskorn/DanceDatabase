# Dance Database

This is an attempt to create a backbone 
for the Scandinavian social dance community 
which the author is very happy to be a part of.

## Goals
1) create a versioned open specification for dance event data
2) create an API that anyone can use to build end user applications upon
3) create a database with event data
4) create an image archive with event related images
4) make it easy for event organizers to add events which can be fanned out to mulitple applications and used in LLMs
5) increase findability for dance events
6) non-profitability of the project

## What Dance is not
It is not meant to be used by dancers directly.
