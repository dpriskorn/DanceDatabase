# Dance Database

This is an attempt to create a data backbone 
for the Scandinavian social dance community 
which the author is happy to be a part of.

## Vision
One place where event organizers publish their events which can then be fanned out to mulitple applications and used in LLMs

A little like https://musicbrainz.org/ is for CDs.

## Goals
1) create a versioned open specification for dance event data
2) create an API that anyone can use to build end user applications upon
3) create a database with event data
4) create an image archive with event related images
5) increase findability for dance events
6) non-profitability of the project

## What Dance Database is not
It is not meant to be used by dancers directly.
It's not a website.

## What Dance Database should provide
1) A UI that make it easy for event organizers to add events 
2) A stable service run by donations

## Nice to have
2) Something that runs in Kubernetes and is reliable and scalable
3) FAIR data with GUPRIs
4) Graph data and statistics
